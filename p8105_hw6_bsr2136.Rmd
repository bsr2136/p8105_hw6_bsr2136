```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 0

```{r p0}
dir.create("files_for_hw6")
```

## Problem 1

### Loading the data, Cleaning it, and Checking for Missing Values

```{r p1 setup, results = F}
birthwt <- read_csv("./files_for_hw6/birthweight.csv")

birthwt <- birthwt %>%
  mutate(babysex = factor(babysex),
         frace = factor(frace),
         malform = factor(malform),
         mrace = factor(mrace),
         )

map(birthwt, ~sum(is.na(.)))
```

There are no missing values, and the 4 categorical variables are now factors.

### Proposed Regression Model

```{r p1 regression model}

```

### Models to compare to

```{r}
model1 <- lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthwt)

model2 <- lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthwt)
```


## Problem 2

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
